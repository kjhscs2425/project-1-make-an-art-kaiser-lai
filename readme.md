# Project Proposal

1. Roughly, what will your drawing look like
a flower

2. What are two variables you could use so that when you change each variable, the drawing changes?
def function and range

3. Where is there repetition in your drawing?
drawing the center of the flower

4. What are the main parts of your drawing? Are there clear sections or objects?
the main part is the spiral that makes it look like a flower

5. How could you use a loop variable of a for loop? Is there somewhere in your drawing where something is repeated, but it's slightly different each time? Maybe the same object is repeated in different places, or maybe a similar object is repeated but with different sizes?
looping I could change the angle and draw a flower.
